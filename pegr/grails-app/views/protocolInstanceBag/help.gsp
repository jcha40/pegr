                <h4>Barcode</h4>
                <p>Barcodes are used to trace samples, antibodies and other items used during the process. The Barcodes have to be UNIQUE for each item type.</p>
                <p>You may use mobile devices to scan the barcode. PEGR is very easy to use on android phones and tablets. The Android devices need to have the "Barcode Scanner" app (based on zxing) installed from the Play Store. From PEGR webpages, click on the <span class="glyphicon glyphic-qrcode"></span> symbol next to the barcode input fields. The barcode sanner will open up automatically. Then scan the barcode, and you will be taken back to the original PEGR webpage with the barcode filled. If you are using iPhone, you may download  "Quick Sacn-QR Code Reader" by iHandy Inc. from the App Store. You need to manully open the scanner, scan the barcode and copy that barcode text back to the PEGR webpage. </p>
