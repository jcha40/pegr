        <h3>Sample Submission</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Assay</h4>
                <p>Each assay has a pre-defined template. All samples in the sample submission form have the same assay. Samples using different assays should be submitted in separate forms.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Sections</h4>
                <p>The sample submission form is separated into three sections: "Sample", "Antibody" and "Target". The header buttons will help you to navigate to the corresponding sections.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Select and Type</h4>
                <p>Click on the fields with placeholder "Select...", a drop-down menu will show up. You may select a choice directly, or type in some characters to narrow down the selections. Fields with placeholder "Select or type..." will allow you to type in new words in addition to the provided selections. Fields without placeholder accept free text. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Multiple selections</h4>
                <p>Some fields, such as "Treatments" and "Reference Genomes", accept multiple selections. Once you enter the first selection, that selection will be wrapped up and prefixed with a remove sign. You may continue to choose additional selections.</p>
            </li> 
            <li>
                <h4>Cascade select</h4>
                <p>When you open up a sample submission form, some fields are disabled (grey) temporarilly. These fields often depend on previous fields. For example, the selection of "Genus" will narrow down the range of "Species". When "Genus" is selected, the field "Species" will be active and a list of species in that Genus will be provided. Likewise, "Species" narrows down "Parent Strain", and then "Strain". The dependencies are list below.</p>
                <p>Sample</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Genus -> Species -> Parent Strain -> Strain -> Genotype -> mutation </li>
                    <li>Species -> Growth Media</li>
                    <li>Species -> Reference Genomes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Antibody</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Catalog -> Host, Immunogene, Clonal, Ig Type and Concentration. </li>
                    <li>Catalog -> Target Type, Target, C-Term and N-Term</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
