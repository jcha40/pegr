JAVA coding style:

1. class names always start with upper case;

2. local variables start with lower case;

3. constants use all upper cases; 

4. do not omit {} in if/for/while blocks; follow general indentation rules.

5. do not omit space around = , e.g. def a = 1; 

6. the length of functions/methods should not exceed a full screen. Otherwise, consider refactoring;

7. always catch and log errors;

8. add as many comments and tests as possible;

9. do not put too much logic in a single line of code.

10. DRY: Do not Repeat Yourself.
